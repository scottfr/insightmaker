/**
 * This example shows simple data binding to models (Ext.data.Model). When the value is
 * changed by the user, the change is reflected to the model and is then validated. The
 * validation is reflected back to the form field to which the value is bound. The
 * validation is based on the length of the field. By looking at the model code, you can
 * see the validator that is attached to the field.
